This is a 43 year old Malaysian-American female with a medical history significant for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2002. Since the birth of her second child in 1992, she has had periodic episodes of abdominal pain with or without N/V about every 6-24
months, usually localized to the RUQ. Most of these episodes have resolved spontaneously without medical care, but she has sought medical care on several of these occasions. In August of 2002, she underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Following this operation, she continued to have periodic abdominal pain, of the same character and at the same frequency as what she had been experiencing before her operation.

She presents with her latest of these episodes. She had been in her usual state of health, until she woke up on Tuesday (4/12) morning with a constant, pinching abdominal pain localized to the right upper and middle upper abdomen. She also felt nauseous, but did not vomit. This pain got worse with intake of food, and seemed to improve after several hours of not eating. By Wednesday morning, her symptoms had mostly resolved, but she continued to feel some mild abdominal discomfort. This mild discomfort continued until Saturday morning, when she began to feel significantly worse. Her abdominal pain increased significantly (10/10) and she began to vomit everything she ate. By Saturday afternoon, she became diaphoretic and her pain continued to increase. She took a Krogerâ€™s antacid Saturday evening, but otherwise did not do anything to treat these symptoms herself. She presented to the Duke ED early Sunday morning, where care was initiated and the patient was admitted to the Gen Med 4 service. She denies having chest pain, dyspnea, fevers, chills, back pain, and diarrhea at any point during this episode. Her most recent bowel movement was Saturday evening, and it was dark brown in color.
